# Robomongo (Robo3T) for Arch Linux
With this you can make an Arch package of Robomongo and install it.

I need to test this in a fresh Arch install (just base and base-devel) so that I can make sure I get the dependencies in the PKGBUILD correct. Once this is done I will publish this to the Arch user repository.
